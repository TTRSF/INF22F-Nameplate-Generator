# System Test Plan

## 1. Objective:
The objective of this test plan is to thoroughly test all functions in all JavaScript files using unit tests, ensuring that each function works as expected and meets the specified requirements.

## 2. Test Environment:
- Programming Language: JavaScript
- Test Framework: Jest
- IDE/Text Editor: Preferred development environment
- Version Control: Git

## 3. Test Strategy:
- **Test Coverage:** Aim to achieve as close to 100% test coverage as possible by writing tests for all functions.
- **Test Prioritization:** Prioritize writing tests for critical functions or functions with complex logic.
- **Test Isolation:** Ensure that tests are isolated and independent of each other to avoid dependencies between tests.

## 4. Test Cases:

### 4.1. Test Suite 1: Functionality Testing
- **Description:** Test the functionality of each function to ensure that it performs the intended task correctly.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify all JavaScript files containing functions to be tested.
  2. Write individual unit tests for each function in the identified files, covering different input scenarios and edge cases.
  3. Execute the tests using Jest or any preferred test runner.
- **Expected Result:** All functions should pass their respective unit tests without errors.

#### TC01.02 Nameplate Generation

### 4.2. Test Case 2: Error Handling
- **Description:** Test the error handling capabilities of functions to ensure that they handle invalid inputs or unexpected conditions gracefully.
- **Steps:**
  1. Write unit tests with invalid input parameters or simulate unexpected conditions.
  2. Execute the tests to verify that functions throw appropriate errors or handle exceptions as expected.
- **Expected Result:** Functions should throw errors or handle exceptions appropriately without crashing the application.

### 4.3. Test Case 3: Integration Testing
- **Description:** Perform integration testing to ensure that functions work correctly together when called sequentially or in combination.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify sets of functions that interact with each other or share dependencies.
  2. Write integration tests to cover scenarios where these functions are called together.
  3. Execute the tests to verify that the integrated functionality works as expected.
- **Expected Result:** Functions should work seamlessly together without unexpected behavior or side effects.

## 5. Test Execution:
- Run the unit tests using the preferred test runner (e.g., Jest).
- Monitor test execution for any failures or errors.
- Investigate and fix any failing tests promptly.

## 6. Test Reporting:
- Document test results, including passed and failed tests, along with any error messages or issues encountered.
- Maintain a record of test coverage metrics to track the code covered by tests.

## 7. Test Maintenance:
- Regularly review and update existing tests to accommodate changes in code or requirements.
- Add new tests for any new functions or features added to the codebase.

## 8. Test Schedule:
- Scheduled test runs: Run full test suite weekly to ensure ongoing code quality.

## 9. Responsibilities:
- Tester: Write unit tests for the functions. Review test results, report any failures or issues, and work with developers to resolve them.

## 10. Risks and Mitigation:
- Risk: Incomplete or inadequate test coverage may result in undiscovered bugs or regressions.
  Mitigation: Prioritize writing tests for critical or high-risk functions and aim for comprehensive test coverage over time.
